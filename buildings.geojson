        "description": "Villa ‘Fortuzi’ was built from Omer Fortuzi, it is believed around 1920. He used to be one of the first Albanian engineers and a member of one of the biggest and most important families in the city. Being once the mayor of Tirana( from 1940-1943), while he had this position he always tried to implement as many Italian projects as he could. The architecture of this villa is a confirmation of this intent too. It represents a very unique villa typology, with a very different architecture, compared to what was usually realized at the time, three-storey house designed with organic curves in all of its floors and very visible in its overall characteristic volumetry. It has an 'L' shape ground-floor blueprint, with two different entrances both accessing on abundant gardens. The main entrance door is very monumental with symmetric organic volumes. The organic lines follow also the way the terrace's metallic handrailing was designed and implemented. Its focal point is the entrance that representing the main symmetry ax of the building, is composed of three, 2 storey high, rectangular columns. The ground floor facade, the three entrance columns and the surrounding walls are covered with red brick tiles an element that links the entire composition of this villa. During communism, it is believed the original owners were expropriated and recently it hosted the offices of the Social-democratic party of Albania",

        "description": "The Villa is positioned in the intersection of ‘Rruga Kont Urani’ and 'Rruga Kavajes' once known as Boulevard ‘Mussolini’ using a surface area of 1437m2. This project was realized in 1935, from the Italian engineer Giulio Berte (who is a very important name in the history of the architecture of Tirana, the one who realized The Palace of Brigades, once ‘The Royal Villa’ and the design of the Scanderbeg Square in Tirana), but the construction works lasted until 1936. This villa was commissioned by the once mayor of the Municipality of Tirana, Abedin Nepravishta ( Mayor from 1934-1936, and 1937-1939). This project was thought to have influenced King Zogu to ask 'Berte' and realize also the project for his residential villa, ‘Royal Villa’ very notable today because of some similarities in terms of their design. Like many other Italian architects of that time, G.Berte also intended a rational style with a representative character, that would evidence itself to the existing architecture, of the surrounding but providing a certain combination of modernity with the respect to the specific urban conditions, towards the main streets. Being a urban house, situated in a crossroad of two very important mobility axes, it’s volumetry as a result, was very defined and geometric, at the same time monumental, providing a view towards the ‘Mussolini’ Boulevard, ‘Ethem Bej Mosque’ and further on to the main ‘Scanderbeg Square’. It has a very clear plan organization, with an underground plan, ground floor plan, first floor, and terrace. Talking about the functional organization, its ground floor was meant to host mixed-use spaces. The main areas along the Boulevard Mussolini treated like duplexes with specific staircases connecting to the first floor and the technical spaces underground. The other part of the ground floor plan was reserved for an apartment that communicated also with the inner garden. Meanwhile, all first-floor space, has a residential use, therefore, represents a more intimate space. Its structural system is a compound one, with perimeter massive walls of 30-45cm and an inner reinforced concrete beam-column system. From 1945 until 1992 it served as a Kindergarten and after 1992 the original owners got it back.",

        "description": "Toptani’s Saray has been built around 1833-1840, one of the least buildings realized during the feudal period, in Albania. It possesses a space of around 32 rooms, all decorated in an oriental ottoman style. It represents a very important architectural complex constructed with massive bearing walls made out of qerpic and anti seismic, wooden wall beams, that give to it the feeling of a fortification or fortress. This being a type of building and construction technique spread in Albania during the second half of the 19th century, during the feudal order. It’s a two-story building, listed as a  Monument of Culture, built with traditional techniques from old masters from Diber. It has special values not only for the inner functional organization but also for its architectural facade treatment and decorations. It's exterior is treated with simplicity, plain and clear volumetry with a white facade and dark wooden decorative windows. It has an abundant garden space in front, with a well and the entire complex is surrounded by high walls with a principle gate. During A.Zogu's regime, it was used as 'The National Library' and further on during Communism, it served as the offices of the Institute of Monuments and Culture (it is believed around 1963). Its ownership returned back to its original owners and for a while was used as a Bar/Restaurant. Despite this, today stands not functional and non-accessible to the public.",

        "description": "This Villa is a Monument of second category. Represents the first mediatic Institution in Albania. The villa was built  in 1938 from a very rich and important family of Tirana 'Kollciu’ with the main purpose to be a house for two brothers, fact  that is  also emphasized by the symmetric plan organization of the villa. Later on it was seized under the order of King Zog and it served as the base for 'Radio Tirana’ until 1965. After that its inner space was used by The Institute of Anthroplogy and Art studies, which later on moved also from there since its private owners appeared again and today It stands in very bad conditions. The villa is composed by four floors and one of them stands underground .It has two main entrances and one of them is directed towards the backyard. It has a very harmonic, neoclassical façade with columns without orders, prefabricated granil (granulated stones composition) staircase, a main hallway with marble tiles, windows with wooden frames, metallic balustrades. Currently there are some people from the 'rome’ community living in the building. It is believed that the actual owner of the Villa led them 'squat’ and clean the inner space before taking back the villa and reconstruct it for its main interest. It is believed. Everything regarding the fate of the villa is a speculation, some of the inhabitants around the neighbourhood say the actual owner wants to recreate a Museum out of it but none of this regarding its fate is yet confirmed .

        "description": "Once the residence place of the 'Toptani' family. Situated within the Castle's walls, in a neighborhood with characteristic features of the XVIII-XIX century civic centers. It stands out for its size and its treatment as a housing-typology with a closed 'çardak', situated on the central part of the castle. It has no resemblance to the houses built in Kruja, during the XVIII-XIX centuries, which are generally enclosed with one floor or half perpendicular floors. This house is part of a residential complex, which according to the ruins that can be seen today, included a second building above it and some other constructions, but it is impossible to distinguish specific, relevant functions. The two main divisions were the upper part of the house, 'the guest-house' also known back then as 'selamlleku' and the lower part(house), the house with the enclosed 'cardak', the family-house or also known as 'haremlleku'. Nowadays the house of guests is in ruins and only a part of the walls remain evidence. Decay problems were encountered in the family-house also, with a number of changes and degradation of the structural elements. The structure is two-story, with an almost equal surface area for both floors. The layout has the shape of the letter L. The floors are connected by an outdoor, stone staircase, which stands out, from the volume of this structure. They are two ramps where one of the ramps rests on a full masonry and the other, on two spaces covered with vaults quarter circular and half-circular. The ground floor is where the four spaces connect with the 'hajat'(ground-floor porch). The first space has served as a living room and that can be guessed by the chimney and six, pairs of windows placed in a certain height. This room is ceiling-free, without plaster and paved with cobble-stones. The second room, that communicates with the first one, is completely unpaved. It is believed, to have served as a deposit. The third area was the food-deposit as the traces show. <br/>The fourth room, similar to the first one, was used as a living room with a chimney. The outdoor staircase leads to the 'çardak', to which all the second-floor rooms, are connected with the exception of the 10th room. The sixth room has a rich decorative ornamentation and this fact shows that it is one of the most important rooms in the house, a guest-house. At its bottom is the volume divided into two parts in height. On the lower part, in the center, you can see what's called 'the musander' next to a niche and behind them the doors leading to the bathroom and the seventh room and to the 'cardak'. 'Mafili' which is the space created on the upper part of this division in height, is completely closed, only a single window opens to the 'çardak' area, and some small glazed openings, overlook towards the room. Wooden stairs make the right connection of the entrance on the right with the space of the 'mafil', this one is made out of a wooden floor and wooden ceiling. The main ceiling of the entire room has eight corners and is made of wood too. The upper part is built with floral ornaments. The seventh room is one of the most interesting. Its 'mafil'(which is used as space for women to see who was visiting but not be seen) is open and relatively large. There is balustrade with wooden grids that give the appearance of a balcony. At its bottom is a 'musander' and a door leading to the bathroom door, which connects to the guest room. The Chimney serving also for the bathroom. Lighting is provided with windows placed two by two on top of each other. Near room 7 there is a small room that gets the light through the four windows placed two by two on top of each other. Characteristic for this space is the chimney with a drum in the form of a pyramid. It is believed to have been the 'fire-house'(shtepia e zjarrit). The tenth room is completely transformed. The fifth room occupies the left part of the 'çardak' area. It is relatively small in size and is illuminated by two-row windows on top of each other. This space has its own bathroom, that gets out of the contour of the house. The house is built with stone walls, its ground floor and a large part of the first floor. The stone masonry is built with stones connected with limestone. The stability of the wall is provided by the wooden beams like made of oak. A large amount of mortar has been used so that from the outside it appears to have been treated with plaster. The roof has been built with locally-sourced materials. The pavements of the living spaces are of wooden boards. Through the process of restoration, there was a process of reassessment of the additions built over the years, dividing additions that had significant value and became part of the dwelling or cases that undermined the architectural value of the complex. The latter, the ones affecting negatively have been removed from the main volume. On the basis of old documents and footage, the main 'çardak' facade, was reconstructed. Restoration works affected almost all volumes.",

        "description": "This house is located in one of the alleys connected with 'Donika Kastrioti' street. It was the property of two brothers and was built by the original owner, the grandfather of the family 'Idriz Bejtekuqi', as one of the wealthiest traders of the time. Built to accommodate a large family of two brothers, the house is quite spacious and quite expanded on its yard also. Organized on two floors, with two separate entrances, each one with arched wooden doors. The facade of the house, becomes more dynamic because breaking its continuity is a volume that stands out, in its central part, similar to the cantilevered volume in the 'korcar' houses, known as 'erker'). The house is one of the richest in detail and colors, on both the interior and exterior. In terms of plan layout and functionality, there is something very unique compared to most of the houses of this typology and period, and that is the division of the enclosed 'cardak' space with the other rooms through a buffer space that resembles the idea of a corridor. Also one of the guest-rooms on the upper floor of the house is also full of ornaments on wood and details, all its upper part of the wall-strip is painted with all sorts of representations. It has a beautiful, ornamented wooden ceiling and different elements like individual 'musandras' on one part of the wall and on the other, the entire wall, arranged with them. Some of the ornaments are falling day by day and the house-entirety is endangered by the passing of time, decay and lack of maintenance.",

Around the 30s of the 20th century it served as the head-center of the English Consulate and today serves as 'The Ethnographic Museum of Durres'. This is the house where the actor 'Aleksander Moisiu' grew up, an important figure of the scenic art in Europe, born to an Albanian father and an Italian mother. Two of today's Ethnographic Museum spaces are dedicated to him. Meanwhile, the other three spaces have been dedicated to the local artisan development and values, of the city and its localities. The house is organized in two floors, it has an external stone staircase that enables the connection of the ground floor with the second floor's 'çardak'( a kind of open portico used in the Albanian vernacular architecture). This staircase is sustained by stone vaults, that rest upon a stone archway. 'Çardaku' is confined, along the main facade, by wooden pillars and also paved with wood. It's restoration happened in 1983. ",

        "description": "This 80-year-old building is otherwise known as the 'King Zog's Villa' and is positioned in a very dominant location, 98 meters above sea level, from where the whole city of Durres can be seen from the three main sides of its eagle-shaped structure. It is thought to have been built in 1927 as a personal gift to King Zog I, from the business community of Durres in a sign of respect and appreciation. The architect of this house is thought to be Prof. Kristo Sotiri, a laureate in Padua and Venice (Italy), who also had an eleven-year experience as the architect of the court of Queen Elizabeth Carmen Silva of Romania. He designed and built one of the most unique villas of the city, that referring to the detailed level of indoor and outdoor decorations and materiality can be seen as a kind of royal palace. The building took its final form in 1937 under the care of Italian architects and specialists, a few months before the Monarch Zog the I'st marriage to the Hungarian Countess, Geraldine. The interiors are gracefully decorated, with a stunning parquet floor and a characteristic, walnut-decorated ceiling. The upper floor is specially designed for the royal couple with balconies that overlook the entire bay of Durres, a testament to a modern building of this period. This villa is quite famous for its different kinds of marble and its grand saloon. Over the years the villa has served for more than 40 years as a waiting residence for various names of the Communist Party, starting from Hrushov to the Cambodian prince, and its most notable host after the 1990s has been the former US President, Jimmy Carter. The building was also used in communist-era for parties and weddings. The building with special architecture was badly damaged in march of 1997, during the collapse created by the pyramid firms, when within two days it was vandalized, stolen, completely destroying the lighting system, which had remained intact since the time it was built. For several years it was used by the international NATO forces, arriving on military missions.",

        "name": "Mic Sokoli tower-house",
        "description": "Located in the village of Bujan, this house was proclaimed a monument on January 8, 1977. The house is of the 'fortified' typology typical of the area of Gjakova with many other features of this typology. This house is organized on three floors where the ground floor is not for living but in the service of livestock also known as 'ahri', while the first floor is In the village of Bujan, in the south-eastern part district of Tropoja, on a high ground rises the 'Tower of Mic Sokolit'. The collapsed walls of the tower, hit many times by the cannons of the foreign invaders, are evidence of the people's resistance and struggle to protect their lands. It is not known exactly when this tower was built, but it is thought about at the end of the 18th century. In addition to the historical value of the figure it relates to, it is of particular importance for the house-typology it represents in the highlands of Gjakova. As a result of a fire in 1945, it has been massively destroyed, losing its floors and roof structure. The tower is made out of three storeys and has a rectangular plan with right angles. The composition scheme of space distribution is as follows: on the ground floor there is' ahri ', on the first-floor women's room, preceded by a hallway, and on the second floor 'divanhania' and the 'guest room'. The connection of all these spaces is realized with wooden stairs inside and outside. 'Ahri' served as a shelter for livestock and horses and had a protective function as one of the safest spaces in all dwellings of this typology. At the perimeter of the tower, there are from one to two 'frengjij' in small dimensions, on each site providing minimal ventilation and illumination, which makes the tower safer. The door is on the north side and is covered with arches. The door is secured from the inside with a wooden beam called 'drang' which is inserted into the open hole in the right part of the masonry wall. <br/>The ground floor of the tower consisted of a single room, the women's room (soba e grave) or 'fire chamber'(oda e zjarrit), the entrance to which was secured by a door on its western side with a single exterior ramp-staircase. Conclusions derived from some traces left on the masonry before restoration. The door, like that in the 'ahri', was covered with a stone-made arch, this one wood-panel door, also secured with the 'drang' element. From the vertical footprint of a column, on the east side of the wall, was deduced and assumed that there was the beginning of a wooden skeleton partition of the women's room with a corridor leading to the sanitary unit. Regarding the women's room environment, it was illuminated and ventilated through some small windows, arched outwards and next to them on each side of this room were 2-3 'frengjij'. On the south side of the Tower are found traces of a chimney, thought to be of a 'tambur' type, with a rectangular, right-angle section. <br />The second floor of the tower: This floor is also the most damaged but due to the importance of careful reading of the footprints, it has been possible to reconstruct the floor layout. This floor contained in its interior the 'guest room' which was preceded by another space 'divanhania', on a smaller surface than the 'guest room' and separated from it, and an interconnected corridor through the 'dyshekllek ' (structure with vertical columns of wood blinded with thick wooden planks). The wooden stairs on the 'divanhane' connects this floor to the 1st floor. The interconnecting corridor of these two spaces leads to the sanitary unit in the eastern part. The perimeter walls on this floor, as in the other two, are limestone masonry walls. The upper-floor restoration was even more difficult as only two walls had resisted.<br/>This building was of double importance for restoration, both historically, as the birthplace of the hero Mic Sokoli, and from the typological point of view of the tower-houses of this area, but at the same time it was very difficult to restore and to decide to restore it since a considerate amount of the object's elements were missing and demolished. The way it was dealt with, was that first consolidation actions were made on the existing walls and also the rebuilding of parts of the tower for which there were traces of their existence. Their reconstruction increased the stability of the existing structure, as with the re-creation of the 'dyshekllek'. The use of typological analogies with other elements of this type of house from the region did not allow for error. Outdoor wooden stairs, horse 'ahri', and the entire interior with lime plaster were also recreated. The 'dyshekllek' was realized as it was always made with oak wood with 8cm timber and more open windows. The roof is made of 'stropil' type and covered with 'furde' (wooden planks) and its bottoms are rounded. The volumetry of the tower represents a prismatic body made of stone and wooden elements, covered with a four-direction inclination wooden roof. The tower was restored within the framework of the 100th anniversary of 'Lidhja Prizrenit', and after its restoration, it became a museum-house about the life and activity of Mic Sokoli.",

Its ground floor was used to accommodate the livestock, so it is slightly lower as a floor with the main entrance, on its main facade. A specific characteristic of this house is the entrance to the second living floor, through a covered staircase made of stone, creating, therefore, a sort of covered protected entrance, that at its higher level is open to the view of the surrounding mountains. The upper floor has two main rooms, one where the main family used to live and the other one, organized on a higher level is the 'guest room', containing a hearth also, wooden pavement and wooden ceiling. Being a tower-house, it doesn't have many openings and windows so two of its facades are completely closed and on one of its corners, a 'frengjij'(small openings on a masonry wall, realized for enemy protection reasons) can be noticed, since it stands out in volumetry.",

        "description": "In a dominant plot of land in the center of the upper neighborhood in Dukat, stands a large ensemble of buildings known by residents as the 'Dervish Ali' Tower. This house is a rare case-study in the architecture of rural houses typology, where we find organically united, separate housing units with different functions, creating a large complex. The complex is the result of several stages of construction. On the plan, it creates a more or less enclosed contour in the shape of a triangle, where on the three peaks rise the three main interconnected constructions, according to two sides with other constructions, while the third side forms the surrounding wall. The house was covered with a two-inclination roof. One of the towers (no. 2) presents a special solution because its volume rises over a village road and the passage is made through a tunnel running along the volume, covered with cylindrical archway. The tower rises as a prismatic volume. The plan has the shape of a square. The volume is broken by a small number of windows as well as many small openings, also known as 'frëngji'. The entrance to the tower is on the back. Upon entry, we have a wooden structure that creates a preface. Here we have the sanitary unit. On the opposite side we have a wooden staircase that leads to the upper floors and in front of the entrance is the fireplace. This tower was used during Communism, as a Museum. Next to tower 2 we have house 1 which is also triangular but with a higher elevation. The ground floor is covered with a cylindrical archway. The first floor has access to the other side of the house. Space is dark and receives light from two small windows in the form of (frëngji). There's a wooden staircase that leads to the upper floor where there is a fireplace, a console-shaped water basin as well as numerous openings (frengjij). House 3 is composed of two rooms, the ground floor and the living areas with the same extension but with separate entrance. House 4 has a great resemblance to house 3. It is composed of two volumes, the ground floor and the upper floor. A partly stone, partly wooden staircase, provides the interconnection. House 5 is formed by open volumes, 'hajati' and 'cardak'. The first has a three-arched collonade on the front, while the second has a lighter arcade with five arches. The ensemble of these towers is striking and homogeneous. The unity and uniqueness of the work have been masterfully achieved eve though not well-preserved at all. The enclosed volumes combined with open construction have been treated with basic architectural elements, thereby emphasizing the mass of stone masonry that gives  the ensemble a stoic and unique appearance.",

The stairs and windows of the ground floor have been rebuilt in Communism. Despite its very deteriorated conditions today, you can still notice elements from its interior like decorated 'musendra' with gold color that show also a certain family status in the village, not being quite common this level of detail. The house was inhabited by two brothers, therefor it had two different entrances according to the part of the house they were using. Cooking was provided through a divided unit, serving as an outdoor kitchen, close to one of the families entrances. The house was also surrounded by high stone-walls with a main entrance gate. Dukat as a village is known for its development and importance that they gave to farming and the care for the livestock. It is believed, they used to have around 120 000 cattle, therefore every house in Dukat had its ground-floor serving as a 'katua'(space for the livestock).",

        "description": "The 'fortified' houses of Laberia are divided into two categories, houses with tower and the Tower. The case of the house in question represents a very special example of 'the house with tower' not only for the village of Vuno but for all the villages in Laberi. It is known as the 'Shane Kota' house and is located in the lower part of the village. It consists of a tower and a typical house with storeys. The tower represents a massive prismatic volume, which rises from a square layout that is slightly different from the top floor containing several windows more than the lower ones, which are more enclosed. While the rest is massive masonry linked with lime mortar, which opens up slightly through some small openings, also known as 'frengji'. This typology was highly preferred by representatives of the wealthy society as well as military personalities, who preferred it as being a safer construction. The tower was organized in three floors, where the ground floor with separate entrance was not designated for living, while the intermediate floor was accessed by external stone stairs. The intermediate floor with the top floor of the tower were connected by internal stairs. The tower has a four-inclinations roof, while the house has a roof with two inclinations. The roof is covered with rounded clay tiles. The complex has clarity and dynamism in the composition. The portions of the entrance gates and some of the corners of the masonry are treated with very interesting decorative stone elements.",

It is a house organized in two equal floors between them with windows of the same size since both ground floor and the first floor were used for living not as 'livestock space' known as 'katoj' as it happened usually in Vuno. The house is symmetrical, distinctive element of this type on its first floor is the erection of a balcony in the central- block of the facade. The main facade facing south and the main entrance to the house are made by a spacious entrance, on the side of the masonry surrounding walls of the house. The entrance gate is made out of decorative wooden panels and with an arched-stone architrave. The entire masonry of the house is made of limestone taken from the quarries of the area and linked by lime mortar, the windows have a stone decorative framing all around them as well as the facade has a characteristic treatment that has been degraded over the years. The main façade is treated with fine plaster, one-round lime work and only the corners of the masonry are highlighted as accentuated decorative elements.",

        "description": "This complex is a cultural monument and is also known as the 'Odise Kasneci' house. It represents a very important typology of the sea-coast houses and reflects the changes made in these typologies after the second half of the 19th century. These changes are reflected in phases and the complex in question is constructed in three phases. This gradual construction has formed the structure of this ensemble as a closed contour, partly as a  result of this specific construction and parts of the surrounding walls, creating in its interior a spacious courtyard. In the first phase, the building develops in fragmented volumes due to the difficult terrain and one side of it develops as a 'half-floor house' (one of the most widespread typologies of houses in the villages of Laberia). The construction of the second phase is a 'storey house'(house me kat) where the ground floor has two cylindrical vaults, designed to provide the 'undamaged base' for the development of a hearth(fireplace) inside the 'fire chamber'(oda e zjarrit). The first archway near the first house was used as a 'zahire' (a room for the preservation of food supplies in winter). Along with this construction, a 'stere'(water deposit unit) was built, next to it. The third phase of the construction has been implemented escalated according to the terrain. In this third phase, a joint exterior plastering has been done, so that the facade on the road has achieved a single-facade treatment and it is difficult to distinguish the construction phases in the entire complex. The second stage house, realized in the corner, has a specific intervention ( wall removal and arching) at the corner, joining the two walls, which represents a characteristic intervention in the building, to facilitate the passage of loaded livestock. The houses have a characteristic treatment of thick limestone masonry taken from the area's quarries, bound with lime mortar. The 'living floor' of the house treated with large and vertically oriented windows meanwhile the ones on the ground floor (Katonj) more reduced. Part of the facade has been treated with thick plaster on the stone masonry, a technique not suited to the tradition of area construction, while part of the stone masonry is usually exposed to the eye.",

This house represents one of the most evolutive ones in terms of architecture and Urbanistics, as it participates in the urban formulation of the street where it stands along. It has a simple and symmetrical plan and volume arrangement, with the main hall as the central connecting element where the main stairs-case also stands. On both sides of the main hall, two residential spaces of 5x5m dimensions are organized, while on the upper floor, on the northern part of the plan, there is a micro-unit, made out of sanitary-joints and a staircase that connects to the sub-roof storage. Also in this house, the central volumetric block is treated with special architectural care and sensitivity, like the characteristic arcades, on both the downstairs and upstairs, supported by constructive columns. Also the treatment with decorative horizontal frames, dividing floors, or decorative window frames or under shelter-frames, etc. The use of shutters, back then, was a new element for and on the ground-floor the placement of protective metallic railings. As for the materials used, this house was made with stone walls, brick walls especially the second floor, interior walls and the use of concrete reinforcement especially on the arches and columns in the central block of the dwelling. Shkodra houses, compared to contemporary Korça houses were not as diverse but were larger in size and with a much more monumental and distinctive facade treatment, despite the fact that the ones in Korça were not left behind in terms of ornamental treatment, with more unique elements like the use of 'erker'(central decorative and functional volume, extruded from the main facade of the house) and other ones.",

        "description": "The house lies on a large plot of land. It preserves a good condition of the surrounding walls, which include two yards separated by a low wall. The yard on the right is relatively large and served for the cultivation of vegetables and fruits while the yard in front of the house contains the usual fixtures of the Shkodran house such as the well, a wash-tube, and logs. The only gate that serves as the entrance to the house is with two panel-doors, made of wood and made of bandages and crafted nails. The gate is completed by a double-drainage roof with a wide shelter supported on the two side walls. Its layout-plan has three parts interconnected between them through the 'çardak' as a space-element. All three parts are two-storey high, with the same surface area. On the ground floor there is an auxiliary space and on the first floor the living space. The ground floor has a porch, also known as 'hajat' that connects with the second space. The space on the back serves as an 'ahur' that is paved with cobblestones and illuminated by two small windows. The first-floor volume is divided into four spaces: the cooking area, the dormitory room, a provisional area where the bathroom and the interconnecting spaces, is located. All of these facilities are simply decorated, with a wooden ceiling and a three-panel window, for lighting. The adjacent area is treated with a very rich interior. The main place is occupied by a very decorative ceiling with a triangular field. The room is illuminated by three windows. The interior of the room is complemented by the chiseled closet, on the 'musander' facade. The ground floor of the house is all made of stone-construction wall. Meanwhile, in the upper floors, there is also wooden construction used and brick walls. The doors are all made out of wood with one panel, simply treated or some more detailed. The roof is made in a traditional technique and continues to further the perimeter of the house in the shape of shelter. <br/>It should be noted that the condition of the basic house elements, appeared quite damaged. Unnecessary additions, that did not carry any architectural value, were removed. The central part was changed, during restoration works, it turned into an open 'çardak'. The 'çardak' space close to the 'guest room' was specifically treated adding a traditional chimney. Some other changes include: the window and door's wooden structure was reconstructed on the left side of the exit to the 'çardak' area. Also, Chimney, wall shelves and 'kamerie' space on one of the doors were rebuilt. There was a restoration of the ceiling and the upper part of the 'trapazan' (typical space created on the upper part of the musander. The ceiling part of the 'firehouse'( the main living room) was rebuilt. For the missing part of the right side of the 'trapazan', the historical footprint was used as a reference to re-create it. After the restoration, space re-gained architectural value again. The ground floor was also included in the restoration where the porch (hajat), was completely cleaned and the windows and doors of the 'ahur'(space for animals), were reconstructed. The floor of the house offers the possibility of a complete reconstruction. Other work was also done on the territory around the house as well as the complete rebuilding of the cobblestones of the 'hajat' area (groundfloor porch), the well, the fillings on the wall and the entrance gate. Currently, Pashko Vasa's nephew's wife lives in it and takes care of the house. The last reconstruction was done two years ago, while the first reconstruction was carried out in the 77 'with the opening of the' çardak '. He used to have a large family and one of the wealthiest in Shkodra, with 3 brothers and 6 sisters. The furniture placed inside the house is actually the original.",

The rest of the house has a considerable horizontal extension, and in one of its parts, the floor-level rises with some stairs to separate it slightly from other areas, therefore serving as a place for meetings with politicians and important figures. The house is divided between Gjon Markagjon's nephew's wife and the tower by one of his granddaughters. This apartment has a massive layout-plan, about 25 rooms in total. During Communism, it was confiscated and utilized for several functions through the years, such as kindergarten, school, dormitory, trade course, etc. In 1991 it was returned to its original owners.
